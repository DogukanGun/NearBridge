# NearBridge

When user sign up the application then he/she chooses a bridge destination from the list that contains the chains application served. After the creation of the bridge, the wallet address of the user is saved into the bridge contract near and the destination chain. While user is creating bridge, he/she gives the his/her contract addresses in those bridges. So the both chainsâ€™ bridge contract know where the request is going to go in that chain. Whenever a bridge contract emits an event, network listener catches the event. Inside the event there are destination chain if the emit comes from near contract, user wallet address and message. Network listener directly sends an event to other chain without any mutation. It is certain that only aim of the bridge is sending the message. All the controls are made by chain bridge contracts. We have an interface which has to be implemented if the user wanna use our bridge. This interface includes a method signed that smart contracts call whenever bridge request comes. This is required due to send message to destination contract.
